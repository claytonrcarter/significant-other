## 0.2.0 - Bachmanity Insanity

* Taught "toggle" command to cache the current file's significant other. This is especially helpful for large projects, where the the "toggle" command may take a while to execute. You'll still experience this delay the *first* time you toggle each file, but execution will be super fast for subsequent toggles on that file and its significant other.
* Added "clear cache" command. [[context](https://github.com/jasonrudolph/significant-other/pull/6#discussion_r82456722)]

## 0.1.0 - First Release

* Initial release. Introduced command to switch between a source code file and its corresponding test file, and vice versa.
